Application Overview
This React-based web application guides users through a simple and interactive flow to capture and download images using their device's camera.

1. Welcome Page 
The app launches with a brief introduction and a Start button.
When the user clicks Start, an Agreement Modal pops up asking for consent to proceed.

2. User Agreement
If the user clicks "Agree": The application proceeds to the Camera Page.
If the user clicks "Disagree": The user stays on the Welcome Page and cannot proceed further.

3. Camera Functionality
On the camera page, users are prompted to grant camera access.
Once access is granted: The camera opens and the user can capture an image of their tongue.
If the image does not contains tongue and is not correct, an error message will be displayed telling to retake the image.
After capturing, users see options to: Retake the image, Save the image

5. Save Functionality
When "Save Image" is clicked: The captured image is downloaded directly to the user's local system.












# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
